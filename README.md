Tea Cozy Project
I still have a lot of confusion on how to work with flexboxes, unfortunately, 
but I was proud to have gotten the website to look as close as it does.

I know I have a lot of extra code where I was trying things out, but I 
honestly don't understand what needs to stay or go.

My goals for this course are to learn some basic html and css to be able to 
teach an introductory course to 9th grades, not to become a developer...
so be gentle with feedback! :)

Thanks!
